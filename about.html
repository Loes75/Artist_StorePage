                    Dennis Princewell Stehr, better known as Mr. Probz, is a Dutch producer and singer-songwriter 
                    with multiple global hits under his belt. Besides having global success, Mr. Probz has a history 
                    with a tremendous amount of ups-and-downs. Mr. Probz found music at young age, when he started 
                    listening to various genres, from Cypress Hill and Wu-Tang-Clan to Nirvana and David Axelrod. 
                    When he was about 15-years-old he started writing rhymes, “I didn’t really perform back then, 
                    but writing worked therapeutic at the time.
                    Mr. Probz can look back at successful years and many more to come. His inner entrepreneur knocked 
                    on the door in 2017. In 2018 he invested in a studio compound and started building his own label 
                    ‘Left Lane Recordings’, releasing both his own music as helping talented artists. “I want to give 
                    back and build on a home base for artists, providing the things that I didn’t have when I was
                    struggling and trying to build my career as an artist”.
